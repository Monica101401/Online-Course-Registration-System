            <h2>About Online Education</h2>
            <p>Online education is a form of education where students use their home computers through the internet. For many nontraditional students, among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising families, online graduations and courses have become popular in the past decade. Often online graduation and course programmes, some of which are conducted using digital technologies, are provided via the online learning portal of the host university.</p>

    <h2>Online Course Benefits</h2>
 <p>Online learning offers teachers an efficient way to deliver lessons to students. Online learning has a number of tools such as videos, PDFs, podcasts, and teachers can use all these tools as part of their lesson plans. By extending the lesson plan beyond traditional textbooks to include online resources, teachers are able to become more efficient educators.</p>

     <h2>Learning is Joy</h2>
      <p>Children are born with a profound desire and capacity to learn. They learn with joy and enthusiasm once their intrinsic tendency to make sense of the world is excited. The primary aim of schooling should be to draw upon this valuable capacity in the young, and offer learning that makes them truly empowered to make sense of life around and ahead of them.</p>
